In badminton, points are scored by hitting the shuttlecock with the racquet so it lands inside the opponent's court boundaries. Players must allow the shuttlecock to bounce once on their side before returning it. The first side to reach 21 points wins a game, with matches being the best of three games. Key rules prohibit catching or scooping the shuttlecock, hitting it twice in succession, and having any part of the body or clothing touch the net. 

Badminton has several major competitions showcasing the world's best talent. The Olympics, BWF World Championships, and prestigious open tournaments like the All England are the most coveted. There are separate disciplines for men's/women's singles, men's/women's doubles, and mixed doubles events. The Thomas and Uber Cups pit the top national men's and women's teams against each other biennially.
