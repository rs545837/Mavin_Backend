# Objective

Please write a very short list of factors of hair loss

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1

**Prompt:**
Here is the next sub-task prompt:

Please write a concise list of the top 5-7 most common causes of hair loss in both men and women. Focus on the key underlying factors and conditions that lead to thinning hair or baldness. For each factor, provide a brief 1-2 sentence description. Format the list clearly with numbers or bullets.

**Result:**
Here is a concise list of the top 5-7 most common causes of hair loss in both men and women, along with brief descriptions:

1. Androgenetic Alopecia (Male/Female Pattern Baldness): A genetic condition triggered by hormones, causing gradual thinning and hair loss, primarily on the crown and frontal regions in men and all-over thinning in women.

2. Alopecia Areata: An autoimmune disorder that causes the body's immune system to attack hair follicles, leading to patchy hair loss or complete baldness in severe cases.

3. Telogen Effluvium: A temporary condition where excessive shedding occurs due to physical or emotional stress, illness, or hormonal changes, causing diffuse thinning.

4. Nutritional Deficiencies: Lack of essential nutrients like iron, protein, zinc, and vitamins can contribute to hair thinning and increased shedding.

5. Medications: Certain drugs, such as chemotherapy agents, blood thinners, and medications for depression, heart problems, and birth control, can cause hair loss as a side effect.

6. Hormonal Imbalances: Fluctuations in hormones, especially during pregnancy, menopause, or thyroid disorders, can disrupt the hair growth cycle and lead to thinning or excessive shedding.

7. Physical or Emotional Stress: Significant stress, whether physical (illness, surgery, or injury) or emotional (mental trauma or anxiety), can push hair follicles into a resting phase, resulting in temporary hair loss.
