### Task 2

**Prompt:**
The task is not yet complete. Here is the next sub-task prompt:

Please search online government databases, business registries, or tax authority websites to try to locate the 15-digit GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number) for the company:

Asia Petrochem Industry 
Address: 7/93, Navin Nagar, Panki, Kanpur - 208020, Uttar Pradesh, India
Phone: +91-512-2691123

Focus your search on official government sources that are most likely to contain a company's GSTIN. If the GSTIN cannot be found through online searches, please provide guidance on how one could go about obtaining the GSTIN directly from the company or from the relevant tax authorities.

**Result:**
After searching through several government databases and business registries, I was unable to locate the specific 15-digit GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number) for Asia Petrochem Industry based in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh.

Since the GSTIN could not be found through online searches, here are a few suggestions on how to potentially obtain it directly:

1) Contact the company: You could reach out to Asia Petrochem Industry directly, either through their provided phone number (+91-512-2691123) or by visiting their office address (7/93, Navin Nagar, Panki, Kanpur - 208020, Uttar Pradesh). As a registered business, they should have their GSTIN readily available to provide upon request.

2) Check with tax authorities: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is administered by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) in India. You could visit or contact the nearest CBIC office/GST Commissionerate office for the Kanpur region and inquire about obtaining the GSTIN for the company by providing details like their name, address, and business activity.

3) Use the GST System's Taxpayer Search: The GST Portal (www.gst.gov.in) has a "Search Taxpayer" facility where you can look up a GSTIN if you have details like the Legal Name of the Business or the state jurisdiction it is registered in. However, this may require more specific information than what is available for Asia Petrochem Industry.

Obtaining the GSTIN directly from the company or through tax authority offices would likely be the most reliable way to get the accurate 15-digit GST identification number if it cannot be found through online searches on government databases or registries.
