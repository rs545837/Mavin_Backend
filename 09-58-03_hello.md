# Objective

hello

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1

**Prompt:**
Here is the next sub-task prompt and search query to help achieve the objective:

Sub-task prompt: Please provide a friendly greeting in response to someone saying "hello". The greeting should be warm, casual and conversational in tone. After the greeting, ask how the person is doing today. The response should be 1-2 sentences long.

**Result:**
Based on the search results, I would avoid the more formal greeting "Ladies and gentlemen..." since the prompt asks for a warm, casual and conversational tone. Here is my attempt at a friendly 1-2 sentence greeting:

"Hey there! How's it going today?"

Hey there! How's it going today?
