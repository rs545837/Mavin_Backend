Here is the refined list of 5 badminton drills:

1) Shuttle Run
Target: Footwork, shot accuracy
Drill: Set up cones or markers in a line. Start at one end and run to each cone, hitting a shuttle to the opposite side of the court before moving to the next cone. Focus on getting into position quickly and executing accurate shots while on the move.

2) Four Corners
Target: Racquet control, shot placement  
Drill: Stand in the center of the court. Hit shuttles to each of the four corners of the opposite court in sequence, alternating forehand and backhand shots. Try to place the shots accurately in the corners with controlled swings.

3) Agility Ladder Footwork
Target: Footwork, agility
Drill: Place an agility ladder on your side of the court. Move through the ladder doing various footwork patterns like two steps in each box, or one foot in each box, while holding your racquet and mimicking different shot motions. This helps improve coordination and footwork speed.

4) 1-on-1 Consistency Rally
Target: Shot consistency, rallying
Drill: Rally with a partner, focusing on keeping the shuttle in play as long as possible with controlled shots to mid-court. Don't try to win the point, just keep a steady rhythm. See how many shots you can string together. 

5) King of the Court
Target: All-around skills under pressure
Drill: Have a group of players line up on one side. The first two players start a point. The winner stays on and the loser goes to the back of the line as the next challenger steps in to play a point. You must win the point to stay on court and keep your "King" position. This drill works on all shots and moving around the full court.
