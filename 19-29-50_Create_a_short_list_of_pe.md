Objective: Create a short list of pens

======================================== Task Breakdown ========================================

Task 1:
Prompt: Here is the next sub-task and prompt for the subagent:

Sub-task: Generate a list of 5 different types of pens, including ballpoint pens, fountain pens, gel pens, rollerball pens, and marker pens. For each type, include the pen name, a brief 1-2 sentence description, and a typical price range.

Subagent prompt: Please create a list of 5 common types of pens, with the following information for each:

1. Type of pen (e.g. ballpoint, fountain, gel, rollerball, marker) 
2. A concise 1-2 sentence description of the pen type and its characteristics
3. The typical price range for pens of that type

Format the list with the pen type as a subheading, followed by the description and price range for each. The list should cover these 5 pen types: ballpoint pens, fountain pens, gel pens, rollerball pens, and marker pens.
Result: Here is a list of 5 common types of pens with descriptions and typical price ranges:

Ballpoint Pens
Ballpoint pens use a gravity-fed ink reservoir and small rotating ball to transfer ink to the paper. They are widely popular for their consistent ink flow and affordability. Typical price range: $0.50 - $5

Fountain Pens 
Fountain pens have an internal reservoir that supplies liquid ink to a metal nib through capillary action. They provide a smooth writing experience and are popular among enthusiasts. Typical price range: $10 - $500+  

Gel Pens
Gel pens use a water-based gel ink that dries quickly and produces vivid, smudge-free lines. They offer a pleasantly smooth writing experience. Typical price range: $1 - $10

Rollerball Pens
Rollerball pens use a liquid ink reservoir and ball tip similar to ballpoints but with a slightly wider ball for smoother ink flow. They combine the control of ballpoints with fountain pen-like smoothness. Typical price range: $5 - $50

Marker Pens
Marker pens contain a fiber tip and water-based ink reservoir. They are used for highlighting, writing on non-porous surfaces like glass/plastic, and artistic purposes like coloring. Typical price range: $0.50 - $10
