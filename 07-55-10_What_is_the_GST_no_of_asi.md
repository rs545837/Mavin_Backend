To find the GST number for Asian Petrochemicals, I suggest the following next steps:

Sub-task prompt: Please search for information on how to find a company's GST number in India if it is not publicly available online. Look for any official government portals, databases, or processes one can use to request a company's GST details. Compile the most relevant and authoritative findings on the steps an individual can take to obtain Asian Petrochemicals' GST number through proper channels. If the GST number itself cannot be found, the results should provide a clear process to formally request it from the appropriate sources.

**Result:**
Here are the key steps I found for obtaining a company's GST number in India if it is not publicly available online:

1. Visit the official GST Portal website (www.gst.gov.in).

2. On the homepage, click on the "Search Taxpayer" option under the "Services" menu.

3. Enter whatever details you have about the company, such as legal business name, trade name, state jurisdiction etc. 

4. Click on "SEARCH" to see if any GST registration details come up for that company.

5. If details are found, the company's GSTIN (GST Identification Number) will be displayed, which is their GST number.

6. If no details are found, there are a few other options:
   - You can file an RTI (Right to Information) application to request the GST details from the concerned tax authorities.
   - For listed companies, you may be able to find GST numbers in their annual reports/financials.
   - You can directly contact the company and request their GSTIN number.

7. The GST Portal also has a toll-free number (1800-103-4786) that you can call to inquire about procedures for obtaining a company's GSTIN.

So in summary, while the GST number for Asian Petrochemicals could not be found directly, the official GST website provides means to either lookup or formally request a registered company's GSTIN through proper channels.
