## Task Breakdown

### Task 1

**Prompt:**
Here is the next subtask and prompt:

Subtask: Implement a basic Python function that prints "Hello World!" to the console.

Prompt: Write a Python function called say_hello() that prints the string "Hello World!" to the console when called. The function should not take any arguments or return any value.

To test your function, write a line of code at the end of the file that calls the say_hello() function.

**Result:**
Here's the implementation of the `say_hello()` function in Python:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello World!")

# Call the function to test it
say_hello()
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Hello World!
```

Explanation:

1. The `def say_hello():` line defines a new function named `say_hello`.
2. The `print("Hello World!")` line inside the function prints the string `"Hello World!"` to the console.
3. The last line `say_hello()` calls the `say_hello` function, which will execute the code inside the function and print `"Hello World!"` to the console.

Note that the function `say_hello` does not take any arguments, and it does not return any value, as per the requirements of the prompt.

## Refined Final Output

Project Name: HelloWorld

<folder_structure>
{
  "HelloWorld": {
    "hello.py": null
  }
}
</folder_structure>

Filename: hello.py
```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello World!")

# Call the function to test it
say_hello()
```

When you run the `hello.py` script, it will define the `say_hello()` function and then call it. The function simply prints the string "Hello World!" to the console.

The project consists of a single Python file named `hello.py` inside the `HelloWorld` folder. The folder structure is represented as a JSON object, where the `HelloWorld` key represents the main project folder, and the `hello.py` key with a null value represents the Python script file.

This is a basic "Hello World" program in Python, which is often used as an introductory example when learning a new programming language. It demonstrates how to define and call a simple function that outputs a message to the console.
