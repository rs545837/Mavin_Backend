## Task Breakdown

### Task 1

**Prompt:**
Here is the next subtask prompt:

Please find the Goods and Services Tax (GST) code for the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP). If there are multiple GST codes for UP, please provide the most commonly used one along with an explanation of when the different codes are used.

**Result:**
Here are the key details on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) code for Uttar Pradesh, India:

The main GST code for the state of Uttar Pradesh is 09.

This 2-digit GST code of 09 is used for all regular intra-state supplies of goods or services within Uttar Pradesh.

There are no other commonly used separate GST codes for UP. The code 09 covers the majority of GST transactions occurring within the state boundaries.

However, in certain specific cases, a different code structure is used in addition to the state code:

- For inter-state supplies from UP to another state, the code is 09AAAAAAA where the last 9 digits represent the PAN number of the supplier.

- For supplies to or from the Union Territories, the code is 09XXXXX where the last 5 digits represent the supplier's Temp ID.

- For online information database access or retrieval services, the code used is 09ZZZZ.

So in summary, while 09 is the standard and most widely used GST code for Uttar Pradesh, certain unique transaction types require adding extra digits to this base state code.

## Refined Final Output

Here is the cohesive final output on the GST code for Uttar Pradesh:

The standard Goods and Services Tax (GST) code for the state of Uttar Pradesh, India is 09. This 2-digit code is used for the majority of intra-state supplies of goods and services occurring within UP.

However, there are a few specific cases where additional digits are appended to the base state code:

1. Inter-state supplies from UP to another state use the format: 09AAAAAAA 
   (where the last 9 digits represent the supplier's PAN number)

2. Supplies to or from Union Territories use the format: 09XXXXX
   (where the last 5 digits represent the supplier's Temp ID) 

3. Online information database access or retrieval services use the code: 09ZZZZ

So while 09 is the main GST code for Uttar Pradesh that covers most transactions, these special cases require adding the appropriate extra digits to the end of the state code to properly designate those types of supplies for GST purposes. The 09 state code remains consistent as the prefix in all cases.
