Here are some of the best lessons and morals from the ancient Indian epic Ramayana:

1. Dharma (righteousness and moral duty): Rama's strict adherence to dharma, even in the face of great personal sacrifice like going into exile, teaches the importance of always following the path of virtue and righteousness.

2. Love and devotion: The unwavering love and devotion that Sita has for Rama, and Hanuman's devotion to Rama, exemplify the power of pure unconditional love and loyalty. 

3. Good triumphs over evil: Rama's ultimate victory over the demon king Ravana symbolizes that while evil may be powerful, goodness and virtue will always prevail in the end with persistence.

4. Leadership and ideal qualities: Rama embodies the ideal qualities of a king - he is virtuous, skilled, strong, just, compassionate and dutiful. His character is an example of noble leadership.

5. Power of faith and devotion to God: Hanuman's single-minded devotion to Rama as God incarnate shows the power of bhakti (devotion) and keeping faith in divine power.

6. Dangers of unchecked desire: Ravana's abduction of Sita, driven by his lust and arrogance, and Kaikeyi's scheming to crown her son Bharata as king, motivated by her desire and anger, show how unrestrained selfish desires can lead one astray to misery.

7. Women's honor: Sita's pure character and Rama's efforts to rescue her when kidnapped emphasize the importance of respecting and protecting the honor of women.

8. Brotherhood and familial bonds: Despite Rama's exile, his brothers Lakshmana and Bharata remain completely loyal to him, exemplifying strong ties of love and dharma between brothers. 

9. Importance of keeping promises: Dasharatha is compelled to fulfill the boons he granted to Kaikeyi, even at great personal agony, showing the significance of always keeping one's word.

10. The power of righteous alliances: Rama's alliance with the vanara army headed by Sugriva enables them to defeat the powerful Ravana, highlighting the strength of partnerships bound by dharma and fighting for a righteous cause.
