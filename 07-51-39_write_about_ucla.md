The distinctive Romanesque Revival architecture defined early buildings like Royce Hall and Powell Library, while more modern styles emerged starting in the 1950s-60s to accommodate UCLA's transformation into a large, nationally prominent research university. After several name changes, it officially became the University of California, Los Angeles in 1958. UCLA's total enrollment now exceeds 45,000 students across its College of Letters & Science and highly regarded graduate schools like Medicine, Law, Engineering, Management, Education and Public Affairs.  

Academically, UCLA is renowned for programs across the sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities.

UCLA faculty and researchers have made pioneering contributions in areas like cancer treatment, brain mapping, artificial intelligence, plasma technology and renewable energy storage. The campus received over $1.1 billion in research grants and contract revenue in 2021. UCLA also operates one of the world's leading academic medical centers and runs a application of online programs and digital content platforms.  

Student life at UCLA is vibrant and diverse, with over 1,000 student clubs and organizations promoting community service, religious/cultural interests, politics, arts, sports and more.
