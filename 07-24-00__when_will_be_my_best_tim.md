Here is the next sub-task prompt:

Perform an astrological analysis for someone with the sun sign of Libra to determine the most auspicious and favorable times for them in the near future based on the current planetary positions and upcoming transits. Identify specific date ranges, if possible, and explain the astrological reasons why those times look especially positive for a Libra. Try to give a degree of certainty for the predictions. The analysis should consider major planetary aspects and transits relevant to the sign of Libra. Limit the outlook to the next 3-6 months.

Here is an astrological analysis for a Libra sun sign focusing on the next 3-6 months:

In mid-May, Venus
Moves through Libra's sky, love blooms - 
Harmony alights

Jupiter's transit 
Brings fortunate chances now -
Late May to mid-June

Embrace solitude
During Libra's metamorphosis - 
Cancer season, June  

From mid-July through
Early September, Libra's hopes
Start taking flight true

Tests arise in late 
Summer, but balanced Venusians 
Have strength to endure

By early Autumn
Libra finds peace from within -
Wishes manifested

With benefic planetary influences like Venus transiting Libra in mid-May and Jupiter's transit in late May to mid-June, there are very auspicious periods for love, pleasant surprises and having wishes fulfilled (High confidence). The Cancer season in June calls for alone time and introspection as Libra prepares for a re-emergence (Medium confidence). From mid-July through early September, hopes and dreams have a higher chance of manifestation under fortunate transits (High confidence). Late summer may bring some tests and challenges, but Libra's balanced nature can handle it (Medium confidence). By early Autumn, Libra is likely to find greater inner peace, gratitude and have more wishes come true (High confidence).

Mid-May: With Venus moving through Libra's sky, this is an auspicious time for love and harmony in relationships. Embrace the positive energy and enjoy the connections you make during this period.
