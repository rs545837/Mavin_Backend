Genghis Khan (c.1162-1227) was a prolific military leader who founded and led the Mongol Empire, one of the largest contiguous empires in history. His early life was marked by hardship, as his father was poisoned when he was young, forcing his family into exile. Despite this, he gradually united the nomadic Mongol tribes through a combination of military strength and shrewd diplomacy.

Under Genghis Khan's leadership, the Mongols embarked on a series of ambitious military campaigns, conquering vast territories across Asia and Eastern Europe. Major victories included the subjugation of the Khwarazmian Empire, Jin Dynasty in North China, and the invasion of Kievan Rus'. His highly disciplined and mobile cavalry forces were virtually unstoppable, aided by innovative tactics and siege engineering.

As a ruler, Genghis Khan was known for his brutality against enemies but also for promoting religious tolerance, establishing a writing system, and advancing civilizational developments like the Silk Road trade network. His reputation was one of an uncompromising yet pragmatic leader who valued loyalty and meritocracy within his ranks.

The Mongol Empire he founded had a profound and lasting impact, facilitating unprecedented levels of cultural exchange and trade between East and West. However, the devastation wrought by his conquests also left a trail of destruction across Eurasia. An intriguing fact is that Genghis Khan forbade the selling of women, outlawed the kidnapping of wives, and instituted religious freedom throughout his empire.
