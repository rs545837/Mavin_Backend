The CEUT (Common Entrance Unified Test) is a national-level standardized exam conducted for admission to various undergraduate programs at participating universities across India. The exam tests students' skills and knowledge across a range of subjects like languages, domain-specific areas, general aptitude, and general knowledge.

The CEUT percentile scores are a major factor considered by universities for granting admissions. A high percentile score, typically in the range of 90-99 percentile, is considered very competitive for admission to top-ranked universities and popular programs like engineering, medicine, etc. Students scoring above 75 percentile have decent chances of securing seats at good state universities and affiliated colleges.

The exact weightage given to CEUT scores versus other components like board exam marks can vary across universities. Some may use CEUT as the sole criteria, while others have a composite scoring system factoring in CEUT percentiles as well as Grade 12 marks.

Additionally, many universities set minimum sectional percentile cut-offs in CEUT that students must clear to be eligible for admissions to their programs. Overall, achieving a high comprehensive percentile score in CEUT is crucial for students aiming to get into their preferred undergraduate courses and colleges in India.

## Refined Final Output

The Common Entrance Unified Test (CEUT) is a national-level standardized exam in India used for admission to various undergraduate programs at participating universities. The exam assesses students' skills and knowledge in subjects like languages, domain-specific areas, general aptitude, and general knowledge.

CEUT percentile scores play a significant role in the college admissions process. A high percentile score, usually between 90-99 percentile, is considered highly competitive for admission to top-ranked universities and sought-after programs such as engineering and medicine. Students scoring above the 75th percentile have a good chance of securing seats at reputable state universities and affiliated colleges.

Universities may differ in how they weigh CEUT scores compared to other factors like board exam marks. Some institutions use CEUT as the sole criterion, while others employ a composite scoring system that takes into account both CEUT percentiles and Grade 12 marks.

Moreover, many universities establish minimum sectional percentile cut-offs in CEUT that students must surpass to be eligible for admission to their programs. Achieving a high overall percentile score in CEUT is essential for students striving to get into their desired undergraduate courses and colleges in India.

In summary, the CEUT exam is a crucial factor in the college admissions process in India, with higher percentile scores greatly increasing a student's chances of being accepted into their preferred institutions and programs.
