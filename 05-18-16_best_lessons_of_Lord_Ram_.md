2. Ideal Relationships - Ram had loving, respectful relationships with his father Dasharatha, brothers Lakshman, Bharat and Shatrughna, wife Sita, friends like Hanuman, and even foes like Ravan in the end. He treated all with compassion. This is a lesson in how to maintain proper relationships.

3. Strength and Courage - Ram's strength was not just physical prowess in lifting the bow or slaying demons, but also tremendous mental and emotional strength. He remained calm, patient and determined even in the toughest of times which reflects his immense courage. 

4. Humility and Simplicity - Despite being a prince and incarnation of God, Ram always remained humble, simple and accessible to the common people. He interacted with sages, boatmen, tribals with utmost respect. This teaches us to let go of ego and treat all equally.
