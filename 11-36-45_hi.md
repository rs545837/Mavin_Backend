### Task 2

**Prompt:**
The objective "hi" does not provide enough context or detail to generate a meaningful sub-task or search query. To properly assist, I would need more information about what specific goal or outcome you are trying to achieve. If you can provide additional details about the nature of the task or problem you need help with, I would be happy to break it down into appropriate sub-tasks and search queries to find relevant information and solutions. Please feel free to elaborate on your objective so I can better understand how to assist you.

**Result:**
Got it, no problem. I don't actually have enough context to break this down into subtasks without more details from you. Please go ahead and provide some additional information about what you're trying to accomplish, and I'll do my best to suggest some relevant subtasks or search queries to look into. The more specifics you can give me about the goal or problem, the better I'll be able to assist. I'm ready when you have those extra details to share.

## Refined Final Output

Hi there! It's great to meet you. I'm happy to chat, but I don't have much context to go on based just on "hi". Feel free to share more about what's on your mind or if there's anything in particular you'd like to talk about. I'm here to listen and discuss whatever topics interest you. The more details you provide, the more I can engage in the conversation. So what would you like to chat about?
