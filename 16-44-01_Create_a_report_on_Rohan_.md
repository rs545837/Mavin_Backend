Result: Here is an updated biography on Rohan Sharma with additional details on his work at the RoMeLa lab at UCLA:

Rohan Sharma is an undergraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), currently in his sophomore year pursuing a major in Computer Science and Engineering. He is actively involved in research at the RoMeLa (Robotics & Mechanisms Laboratory), contributing to cutting-edge robotics projects.

One of the key projects Rohan has worked on is the development of a novel robotic platform called HexaMorph, which features compliant legs inspired by the locomotion of insects and small animals. This platform aims to enable robust and versatile movement over challenging terrains. Rohan's role involved designing and implementing the kinematics and control systems for HexaMorph, utilizing programming languages such as Python and C++. He has developed algorithms for gait generation, trajectory optimization, and feedback control to enable the robot's agile and adaptive locomotion.

In addition to HexaMorph, Rohan has contributed to other projects at RoMeLa, including the conversion of robotic models from URDF (Universal Robot Description Format) to MJCF (Multi-Joint motion XML Format) for use in simulation environments. This work involved writing scripts to automate the conversion process and ensure compatibility with different simulation tools.

Rohan's research at RoMeLa has been showcased through presentations at lab meetings and campus events. He co-authored a paper on the HexaMorph platform, which was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in 2022.

Beyond his research endeavors, Rohan has actively participated in robotics-related courses and extracurricular activities at UCLA. He excelled in classes such as "Introduction to Robotics" and "Mechatronics," gaining hands-on experience in robot design, programming, and control. Rohan is also an active member of the UCLA Robotics Club, where he collaborates with peers on robotics projects and participates in competitions.

Rohan's exceptional academic performance and research contributions have earned him numerous accolades. In addition to the prestigious Regents Scholarship, he received the Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science. Rohan's ultimate career goal is to pursue a graduate degree in robotics and work in the field of advanced robotics systems for space exploration or disaster response.

Through his work at the RoMeLa lab and his involvement in various robotics activities, Rohan is gaining invaluable experience and developing a strong foundation in robotics, programming, and mechatronic system design. His dedication, technical skills, and passion for robotics position him well for future success in this field.
