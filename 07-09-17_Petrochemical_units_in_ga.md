## Task Breakdown

### Task 1

**Prompt:**
Here is the next subtask and subagent prompt:

Subtask: Research and provide a list of the major petrochemical units or companies located in Gautam Budh Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh, India. For each unit, include the name of the company, what products they manufacture, and a brief overview of their operations if available.

Subagent prompt: 
Please research and create a list of the significant petrochemical manufacturing units and companies that are located in the Gautam Budh Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh state in India. For each petrochemical unit you identify, please provide:
- The name of the company that owns/operates the unit
- The main petrochemical products that the unit manufactures 
- A brief 1-2 sentence overview of the unit's operations, production capacity, or any other key facts, if such information is readily available

Aim to identify at least 3-5 major petrochemical units in the district, but list as many significant ones as you can find. Present the information in a clear and organized manner. Let me know if you have any other questions!

**Result:**
Unfortunately I could not find any major petrochemical manufacturing units or companies located specifically in the Gautam Budh Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh, India based on my searches.

The search results provided information about a software company (MQ Software) investing in Gautam Budh Nagar, Microsoft establishing a software development project there, and a chemical manufacturing company (HYDROSYS INNOVATION) operating in the district. However, these do not appear to be petrochemical manufacturing units.

Gautam Budh Nagar is known more for being an industrial and IT hub near Delhi, with companies in sectors like software, electronics, automobiles etc. I could not find credible information about any significant petrochemical plants, refineries or related manufacturing facilities located in this particular district.

Unless I am able to find more specific data about petrochemical units from other sources, I do not have enough information to provide a list as requested in the prompt. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details that could aid the search.
